  ADMG Inventory
</h1>

The goal of this project is to build a centralized airborne data inventory for easier user access to data and information. Airborne scientists and researchers would like to

- get curated and organized data context for efficient data search,
- gain detailed information with consistent terminology about ongoing and past airborne campaigns in a one-stop-shop for airborne data resources and information
- quickly* find and access relevant data products and view the associated context (* quickly could mean _fewer clicks_)
- provide feedback on inventory contents, noting inaccuracies or requesting ADMG for more details
