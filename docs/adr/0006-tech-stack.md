## Context and Link

This is a retroactive ADR from a closed issue to keep a papertrail of the decision-making around CASEI UI tech stack - using Gatsby and why. Moving to this folder because it's written similar to an ADR format already.

The tech stack arguments and discussion: [Tech stack #4](https://github.com/NASA-IMPACT/admg-casei/issues/4)
