Due to its high thrust-to-weight ratio, the Learjet can climb at extremely high rates, up to 6,000 feet per minute at sea level and 2,000 feet per minute at 25,000 feet. This level of performance, coupled with SPEC’s state-of-the-art cloud particle probes and a relatively low hourly cost, make the Learjet a unique platform for cloud physics research.",

The aircraft has been modified with two nadir-viewing ports:  29.5 x 29.5-in. in the forward section of the passenger cabin and 26.75 x 22.5 in. in the aft section.  These downward-looking portals allow the use of a wide variety of optical, laser, or R-F based devices that might require a nadir look angle out of the aircraft.  Research-supporting subsystems, such as electrical power distribution, TCAS, GPS and satellite phone communications also have been installed.  The crown of the aircraft has been structurally modified to accommodate atmospheric sensors, such as an isokinetic aerosol inlet.  Finally, a pylon has been mounted beneath each wingtip.  These pylons are suitable for carrying aerosol probes with weights of up to 50 lbs.  In its current configuration, the aircraft serves as the primary flight platform for a suite of aerosol and cloud remote-sensing instruments, including the NASA Langley High Spectral Resolution LIDAR (HSRL).  The aircraft is fully IFR capable.",

CAMS, like DFGAS, is based on tunable mid-IR (3.53-μm) absorption spectroscopy utilizing advanced fiber optically pumped difference-frequency generation (DFG) laser sources. Mid-Infrared light at 2831.6-cm-1 (3.53 μm) is generated by mixing two near-IR room temperature lasers (one at 1562 nm and the other at 1083 nm) in a non-linear crystal (periodically poled lithium niobate). The DFG laser output is directed through a multipass Herriott absorption cell (90-m pathlength in ~ 1.7 liter volume) where the laser light is selectively absorbed by a moderately strong and isolated vibrational-rotational absorption feature of CH2O. The transmitted light from the cell is directed onto an IR detector employing a number of optical elements. A portion of the IR beam is split off by a special beam splitter (BS) before the multipass cell and focused onto an Amplitude Modulation Detector (AMD) to capture and remove optical noise from various components in the difference frequency generation process. A third detection channel from light emanating out the back of the beam splitter is directed through a low pressure CH2O reference cell and onto a reference detector (RD) for locking the center of the wavelength scan to the absorption line center. The mid-IR DFG output is simultaneously scanned and modulated over the CH2O absorption feature, and the second harmonic signals at twice the modulation frequency from the 3 detectors are processed using a computer lock-in amplifier [Weibring et al., 2006].",

The HSRL instrument is an innovative technology that is similar to radar; however, with lidar, radio waves are replaced with laser light. Lidar allows researchers to see the vertical dimension of the atmosphere, and the advanced HSRL makes measurements that can even distinguish among different aerosol types and their sources. The HSRL technique takes advantage of the spectral distribution of the lidar return signal to discriminate aerosol and molecular signals and thereby measure aerosol extinction and backscatter independently.  The HSRL provides measurements of aerosol extinction at 532 nm and aerosol backscatter and depolarization at 532 and 1064 nm. The HSRL measurements of aerosol extinction, backscattering, and depolarization profiles can be used to characterize and quantify aerosols properties, types, and variability.",

Two water vapor absorption lines are used: a “weak” line at 1853.37 nm for lower tropospheric mixing ratios and a “strong” line at 1854.03 nm for middle and upper tropospheric concentrations. VCSELs have a wide current tuning capability and can probe each line by changing the laser injection current with only slight adjustments to the laser temperature. Switching between the absorption lines generally occurs near a fractional absorption of 10-3, though a hysteresis is built in to prevent rapid switching near this transition (generally a factor of four in each direction). The thresholds for line switching changes slightly with temperature and pressure, but it generally is in the -15 to -25 C frost point range.",

          "description": "The Particle Into Liquid Sampler (PILS) was developed for rapid automated on-line and continuous measurement of ambient aerosol bulk composition. The general approach is based on earlier devices in which ambient particles are mixed with saturated water vapor to produce droplets easily collected by inertial techniques. The resulting liquid stream is analyzed with an ion chromatograph to quantitatively measure the bulk aerosol ionic components. In this instrument, a modified version of a particle size magnifier is employed to activate and grow particles comprising the fine aerosol mass. A single jet inertial impactor is used to collect the droplets onto a vertical glass plate that is continually washed with a constant water diluent flow of nominally 0.10 ml min-1. The flow is divided and then analyzed by a dual channel ion chromatograph. In its current form, 4.3 min integrated samples were measured every 7 min. The instrument provides bulk composition measurements with a detection limit of approximately 0.1 µg m-3 for chloride, nitrate, sulfate, sodium, ammonium, calcium, and potassium.",

This instrument has similar functional capabilities to the proposed EOSP satellite instrument. The picture above shows the assembled RSP instrument with its liquid nitrogen dewar on the left side and scanner assembly on the right. Currently data acquisition is performed on a laptop, which is shown here and gives an indication of the size of the instrument. The scientific requirements for the polarimetric measurements are satisfied by the RSP through its high measurement accuracy, the wide range of viewing angles measured and by sampling of the spectrum of reflected solar radiation over most of the radiatively significant range. The RSP instrument uses a polarization compensated scan mirror assembly to scan the fields of view of six boresighted, refractive telescopes through ±60° from the normal with respect to the instrument baseplate. The refractive telescopes are paired, with each pair making measurements in three spectral bands. One telescope in each pair makes simultaneous measurements of the linear polarization components of the intensity in orthogonal planes at 0° and 90° to the meridional plane of the instrument, while the other telescope simultaneously measures equivalent intensities in orthogonal planes at 45° and 135°. This approach ensures that the polarization signal is not contaminated by uncorrelated spatial or temporal scene intensity variations during the course of the polarization measurements, which could create false polarization. These measurements in each instantaneous field of view in a scan provide the simultaneous determination of the intensity, and the degree and azimuth of linear polarization in all nine spectral bands.",

          "description": "This is a device designed to determine the electrical conductivity of the atmosphere. By using a capacitor exposed to a sample of air and measuring the time it takes for discharge, the electrical conductivity of the sample is determined. The Gerdien condenser probe has the ability to sense both positive and negative ion conductivities. The probe utilizes a concentric, cylindrical electrode geometry with the inner and outer electrodes serving as the collector/guard and return electrodes, respectively. The ion conductivity is determined by applying a voltage (V) that is swept linearly between the two electrodes over a 1-minute period, and measuring the resulting current (I). The slope of the I?V characteristic (dI/dV) provides the conductivity measurement. Special construction techniques were used at the collector input to reduce stray leakage currents and susceptibility to electromagnetic interference (EMI). The length of the collector is 6.4 cm. The inner electrode extends another 10 cm as a guard section that is used to mechanically support the center electrode and the inner electrode is recessed 3.8 cm from the leading edge of the outer cylinder. The whole assembly has a length of 20 cm and a mass of 0.286 kg. It was mounted via a 7.6 cm sidestrut to the underside of the aircraft. A separate electronics box contained the sweep and data amplifier electronics.",

The instrument can also provide the optical size of individual particles containing rBC, and identify the presence of materials associated with the BC fraction (i.e. identify the rBC’s mixing state). Since its introduction in 2003, the SP2 has been substantially improved, and now can be considered a highly competent instrument for assessing BC loadings and mixing state in situ.  NOAA deploys multiple SP2s with different designs: the first was built for the WB-57F research aircraft. Two others are rack-mounted units customized at NOAA; one of the rack mounted units can be humidified, and has been deployed with a paired dry rack-mounted SP2 as the \"Humidified-Dual SP2\" (HD-SP2).

The modifications were primarily to lower the temperature in the region where droplets grow on condensation nuclei, which was necessary because the 60 C growth temperature of the standard 3786 is the boiling point when the pressure is about 200 mb, and the GV flies well above this altitude. Other changes were made to the flow control, flow rates, pumps, and water injection scheme to adapt to the large altitude range of the G-V. One substantial advantage of this instrument over other CN counters is that it does not depend on butanol as the operating fluid and so does not require handling of a flammable gas around the aircraft or flight with a flammable substance.The threshold particle size detected by the WCN is about 5 nm, becoming larger at low pressure but remaining below the ultra-fine size range (<10 nm) at pressures as low as 150 mb. The instrument also is relatively insensitive to coincidence losses, continuing to perform with coincidence losses <10% up to concentrations around 105 cm-3. Tubing losses can be significant for small particles, so size-dependent and pressure-dependent corrections may be needed unless the lines can be kept very short (not more than a few m).",

The seven antennas that comprise the LDAR network allow detection of 99% of all intra-cloud and cloud to ground flashes that occur within 10 kilometers of the instrumentation. Each antenna detects the 66 Megahertz Very High Frequency (VHF) pulse from an intra-cloud flash and an electric field detector detects cloud to ground flashes by measuring changes to the electric field from the flash. The root mean square error of the location of each of the detected flashes varies between 100 meters from within the network to approximately 10 kilometers within 90 kilometers outside the network.

The UV DIAL system uses five laser (or lidar) wavelengths in three different regions of the electromagnetic spectrum: two in the UV region for ozone measurements, two in the visible region, and one in the near infrared (IR) region. IR and visible wavelengths both measure aerosols and clouds. Comparing these two wavelengths can reveal information about the size distribution of aerosols. The two UV wavelengths determine the profile of ozone by analyzing the absorption differences due to ozone between the two lidar returns. From this measurement, scientists can determine the location and amount of aerosols, clouds, and ozone along the line-of-sight of the UV DIAL system.",
