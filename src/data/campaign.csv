AirMOSS;Airborne Microwave Observatory of Subcanopy and Subsurface;The NASA Airborne Microwave Observatory of Subcanopy and Subsurface (AirMOSS) campaign focused on observations of root zone soil moisture (RZSM) and net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of carbon dioxide over a variety of North American biomes across several seasons. AirMOSS completed 34 deployments from 2012-2015, over parts of Canada, the US, and Costa Rica. Airborne observations included P-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) measurements as well as carbon and other gas concentrations. AirMOSS supports NASA’s carbon cycle and ecosystems, climate, and Earth surface missions.;The NASA Airborne Microwave Observatory of Subcanopy and Subsurface (AirMOSS) investigation provided high-resolution observations of root-zone soil moisture over nine major North American biomes. The campaign goals were to quantify the impact of variations in soil moisture on the estimation of regional carbon fluxes and to extrapolate the reduced-uncertainty estimates of regional carbon fluxes to the continental scale of North America. The AirMOSS campaign used an airborne ultra-high frequency synthetic aperture radar flown on a Gulfstream-III aircraft to derive estimates of soil moisture down to approximately 1.2 meters.

Airborne instruments looked at how atmospheric chemistry is transformed by various air pollutants and at the impact on CH4 and O3. Mitigation of these short-lived climate forcers is a major component of current international policy discussions. ATom deployed an extensive gas and aerosol payload on the NASA DC-8 aircraft for systematic, global-scale sampling of the atmosphere, profiling continuously from 0.2 to 12 km altitude. Flights occured in each of 4 seasons between 2016 and 2018. They originated from the Armstrong Flight Research Center in Palmdale, California, flew north to the western Arctic, south to the South Pacific, east to the Atlantic, north to Greenland, and returned to California across central North America. ATom established a single, contiguous global-scale data set. This comprehensive data set will be used to improve the representation of chemically reactive gases and short-lived climate forcers in global models of atmospheric chemistry and climate. Profiles of the reactive gases will also provide critical information for validation of satellite data, particularly in remote areas where in situ data is lacking.;Atmospheric Composition, Carbon Cycle & Ecosystems, Climate Variability & Change;human-produced air pollution, methane, ozone;western Arctic, south Pacific, Atlantic, Greenland, Central North America;;year round;7/29/2016;5/21/2018;4;N/A;NASA;EVS-2;Jennifer Olsen;Dave Jordan (NASA PM), Steven Wofsy (Harvard PI);;Aircraft, Model Output, Balloons;DC-8;DC-8: AMP, AO2, ATHOS, CAFS, CAPS, CIT-CIMS, DLH, GT-CIMS, HR-AMS, ISAF, Medusa, MMS, NOAA CIMS, Picarro, NOyO3, PALMS, PANTHER, PFP, QCLS, SAGA, SP-2, TOGA, UCATS, WAS;model, sondes;CAMChem, GEOSChem, GEOS5, GFDLAM3, GISSE2, GMI, GMI4D, GMICTM, UCICTM, WRF, ozonesonde, radiosonde;48;air quality, atmospheric chemistry, ozone, methane;1142, 1207, 1195, 1157;https://doi.org/10.3334/ORNLDAAC/1581;;;;https://esdpubs.nasa.gov/pubs_by_mission/ATom;;20;;ORNL;https://daac.ornl.gov/cgi-bin/dsviewer.pl?ds_id=1581;;https://espo.nasa.gov/atom/content/ATom, https://daac.ornl.gov/ATOM/campaign/;N/A;N/A;N/A;FALSE;75ec4186-d922-45bc-bd71-2e22ee2ff96d;;"there wasn't an overall paper on the campaign--thinking that may be due to datasets still being published to this day for the project

CPEX;Convective Processes Experiment;;"The NASA Convective Processes Experiment (CPEX) aircraft field campaign took place in the North Atlantic-Gulf of Mexico-Caribbean Oceanic region during the early summer of 2017. This campaign hoped to collect data that can help to answer questions about convective storm initiation, organization, growth, and dissipation. The science objectives of the CPEX campaign were:

1.) Improve understanding of convective processes including cloud dynamics, downdrafts, cold pools and thermodynamics during initiation, growth, and dissipation. Determine what combinations of environmental structure, including moist entropy budgets, and convective properties such as vertical velocity and reflectivity profiles, result in rapid upscale growth of a convective system into a large organized mesoscale convective system (MCS), or alternatively, result in failure to grow or rapid decay.

2.) Obtain a comprehensive set of simultaneous wind, temperature, and moisture profiles, using wind lidar, microwave radiometer and sounder, and GPS dropsondes, conduct a quantitative evaluation of those profiles in the vicinity of scattered and organized deep convection, especially in the lowest 4 km, in all phases of the convective life cycle.

3.) Improve model representation of convective and boundary layer processes over the tropical oceans using a cloud-resolving, fully coupled atmosphere-ocean model. Assimilate the wind, temperature and humidity profiles from the wind lidar and dropsondes into the model, and quantify the impact of these detailed lidar wind profiles on the ability of the model to simulate the life cycle of convective systems over tropical oceans.";Weather;convection, cloud dynamics, cold pools, downdrafts, wind, temperature, moisture, rain, humidity, boundary layer;North Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico, Caribbean Ocean region;29, 16, -69, -97;boreal summer;5/25/2017;6/25/2017;1;6/15/2017,6/17/2017, 6/20/2017, 6/23/2017, 6/24/2017;NASA;Atmospheric Dynamics Program;Ramesh Kakar;Ed Zipser, Shuyi Chen;NID;Aircraft, Land-based Platforms, Model, Satellites;DC-8;DC-8: APR-2, DAWN, HAMSR, MASC, MTHP, Dropsonde;NID;NID;16;surface temperature, humidity, local winds, surface winds, upper level winds, boundary layer winds, line of sight winds, wind profiles, atmospheric winds;1285, 1305, 1344, 1351, 1360, 1352, 1381, 1385, 1386;https://doi.org/10.5067/ASDC_DAAC/CPEX/DAWN_DC8_1;CPEX Logo;https://cpex.jpl.nasa.gov/assets/images/cpex_logo.png;NASA;NID;NID;1;;ASDC;https://eosweb.larc.nasa.gov/project/cpex/cpex_dawn_dc8;;"https://cpex.jpl.nasa.gov/

DC3;Deep Convective Clouds & Chemistry;The Deep Convective Clouds and Chemistry (DC3) field campaign focused on the impacts of deep, mid-latitude continental convective clouds, including their dynamical, physical, and lightning processes, on upper-tropospheric composition and chemistry. DC3 had a single deployment over the majority of the continental US, with operations over Colorado, Texas, Oklahoma, and Alabama, during May and June of 2012. Three airborne platforms collected in situ and remote sensing observations that included: specific gas and chemical concentrations, cloud and precipitation particle microphysical properties, and temperature and water vapor content profiles. Ground-based observation sites included scanning radars and launched balloons. DC3 was funded through NASA’s Tropospheric Composition Program.;The Deep Convective Clouds and Chemistry (DC3) field campaign utilized instrumented aircraft platforms to investigate the impact of deep, midlatitude continental convective clouds, including their dynamical, physical, and lightning processes, on upper-tropospheric (UT) composition and chemistry. The two major goals of DC3 were 1.) quantify and characterize the convective transport of emissions and water to the upper troposphere within the first few hours of active convection, investigating storm dynamics and physics, lightning and its production of nitrogen oxides, cloud hydrometeor effects on scavenging of species, surface emission variability, and chemistry in the anvil, and2) quantify the changes in chemistry and composition in the upper troposphere after active convection, focusing on 12–48 h after convection and the seasonal transition of the chemical composition of the UT.

DISCOVER-AQ;Deriving Information on Surface Conditions from COlumn and VERtically Resolved Observations Relevant to Air Quality;;"Improve the interpretation of satellite observations to diagnose near-surface conditions relating to air quality.

In recent years, progress in reaching air quality goals has begun to plateau for many locations. Furthermore, near-surface pollution is one of the most challenging problems for Earth observations from space. However, with an improved ability to monitor pollution from satellites from DISCOVER-AQ, scientists could make better air quality forecasts, more accurately determine the sources of pollutants in the air and more closely determine the fluctuations in emissions levels. In short, the more accurate data scientists have at hand, the better society is able to deal effectively with lingering pollution problems. 

The campaign employed NASA aircraft to make a series of flights, with scientific instruments on board to measure gaseous and particulate pollution, beginning in 2011. The series of flights made by NASA Langley's King Air and NASA's P-3B commenced over Baltimore-Washington, D.C. in 2011. Other flights included Houston (2013); San Joaquin Valley, CA (2013); and Denver (2014). Measurements were taken in concert with ground observations in order to shed light on how satellites could be used to make similar, consistent measurements over time, with the ultimate goal of putting better data in the hands of policymakers and elected officials.

Field Experiment [FIFE], with deployments in 1987 and 1989 to
the Konza Tallgrass Prairie near Manhattan, KS—see The FIFE and
BOREAS Study Areas on pages 8–9—to measure surface properties (e.g.,
vegetation and vegetation status, soil moisture) and fluxes of heat, moisture,
and trace species. The surface flux measurements were used as ground truth for
the development and evaluation of algorithms to estimate fluxes from satellite observations. FIFE’87 had four, two-week deployments2
involving 5 satellites, 10 aircraft,
and some 150 people. Researchers returned to Kansas two years later for a second
round of experimentation on the Konza Prairie—FIFE’89. Measurement approaches
were refined based on the results of FIFE’87 so as to resolve scientific questions that
arose during subsequent algorithm development to estimate fluxes from satellites.";Carbon Cycle & Ecosystems;;Central Kansas;;;6/9/1905;6/11/1905;2;;;;;;;Aircraft, In-situ Ground-based Platforms, Satellites;NASA: C-130/DC-8/U-2/Helicopter, NCAR King Air, de Havilland Canada NAE DH-6 Twin Otter, U-Wy King Air, NOAA Aerocommander;[variety of radiometers, scatterometers, scanners (C-130, Heli, NOAA Aero)], [Canada Twin O, NCAR King Air, UW King Air (flux measurements of heat, moisture, momentum and CO)];AVHRR, Landsat, SPOT, GOES, meteorological stations;;;;;;;;;;;;;ORNL;;;"https://daac.ornl.gov/FIFE/FIFE_About.html

GRIP;Genesis and Rapid Intensification Processes;The Genesis and Rapid Intensification Processes (GRIP) campaign focused on airborne observations of intensifying tropical cyclones to better understand the processes involved and predictability of rapid intensification. GRIP had a single deployment over August and September of 2010, with data taken in systems occurring in the Gulf of Mexico, Atlantic, Caribbean Sea, and one event in the Northeast Pacific. GRIP was the first research field campaign to use the Global Hawk platform over tropical cyclones. Airborne observations included radar, radiometers, dropsondes, and in situ observations. GRIP supported NASA’s Hurricane science and TRMM missions.;The Genesis and Rapid Intensification Processes (GRIP) experiment was conducted to better understand how tropical storms form and develop into major hurricanes. Primary focus of GRIP was the genesis and rapid intensification of hurricanes in the northern Atlantic Ocean basin. This campaign was conducted to capitalize on emerging airborne science platforms and space-based assets. The two major goals were to (1) improve understanding of the environmental (e.g., vertical wind shear, upper-level outflow jets, low- to mid-level moisture, upper-level troughs), oceanic (e.g. warm ocean eddies), and inner-core (e.g., convective bursts, mesovortices) factors that govern RI and (2) assess the predictability of RI, including what observations would be most critical to its prediction.;Weather;Tropical cyclones, tropical storms, hurricanes, rapid intensification, precipitation;Tropical Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico, Eastern North Pacific, Caribbean Sea;40, 0, -60, -130;boreal summer, boreal fall;8/15/2010;9/25/2010;1;08/29/2010, 08/30/2010, 09/01/2010, 09/02/2010, 09/06/2010, 09/07/2010, 09/16/2010, 09/17/2010;NASA;;Ramesh Kakar;Scott Braun;NID;Aircraft, Satellites;DC-8, WB-57, GH;"DC-8: LARGE, MMS, APR-2, DAWN, LASE, CAPS, CSI, PIP probe, Dropsonde

OLYMPEX;Olympic Mountains Experiment;The Olympic Mountains Experiment (OLYMPEX) was one of the Global Preciptation Measurement program Ground Validation field campaigns held in the Olympic Penninsula of the Pacific Northwest during the winter of 2015-2016. The goal of OLYMPEX was to validate rain and snow measurements in midlatitude frontal systems as they moved from ocean to coast to mountains and to determine how remotely sensed measurements of precipitation by GPM can be applied to a range of hydrologic, weather forecasting, and climate data. The OLYMPEX campaign utilized a wide variety of ground instrumentation, mobile radars, and airborne instrumentation to monitor the storm systems as they approached and traversed the Olympic Mountains. The OLYMPEX campaign was part of the development, evaluation, and improvement of GPM remote sensing precipitation algorithms. Airborne observations included multiple instruments on the NASA DC-8 and ER-2, as well as cloud probes on the UND Citation. The campaign used the airborne measurements as well as mobile radar and ground station instrumentation to gather in-situ measurements of rain and snow for comparison with satellite observations of the mid-latitude storms and atmospheric river events. OLYMPEX was one of many campaigns utilized in the Global Precipitation Measurement mission Ground Validation effort.;This campaign’s focus area was the Olympic Peninsula in Washington, USA. This campaign used airborne instruments as well as radar and ground station instruments to gather in-situ data of rain and snow to compare to satellite observations of the same storms.

ORACLES;ObseRvations of Aerosols above CLouds and their intEractionS;;The ObseRvations of Aerosols above CLouds and their intEractionS, or ORACLES, project was instituted to study the key factors that lead to climatic impacts of African biomass burning (BB) aerosols. ORACLES took place between 2016 and 2018 with three primary Intensive Operation Periods, or IOPs, occurring during that time span. The primary focus area for this project was over the southeastern Atlantic where the majority of radiative impacts from BB aerosols normally take place. The two main goals of this project were as follows: 1) to study the impact of BB aerosols on both cloud properties and the radiation budget within the study area using both in situ and remote sensing methods and 2) to better understand the process of aerosol-cloud-radiation interactions and the resulting cloud adjustments, which will eventually be resolved in global models.;Climate Variability & Change, Atmospheric Composition, Global Water and Energy Cycles;aerosol concentration, aerosol-cloud interactions, climate;SE Atlantic;40, -24, 15, -126;boreal summer;8/19/2016;10/27/2018;3;9/20/2016, 08/13/2017;NASA;EVS-2;Bernadette (Bernie) Luna;Jens Redemann;Yohei Shinozuka;Aircraft;ER-2, P-3;ER-2: eMAS, SSFR, HSRL-2, RSP, AirMSPI, P-3: 4STAR, SSFR, COMA, HIGEAR, APR-3, HSRL-2, RSP, AMPR, 2DS, CIP, HVPS, CAS, PCASP, King hot wire probe, PDI, TAMMS, water isotopes;Models;N/A;39;aerosols, aerosol particle properties, dust/ash/smoke, cloud properties, biomass, biomass burning, climate feedbacks, atmospheric radiation;1130, 1118, 1125, 1428, 2024, 2493, 2205, 1256;N/A;;;;https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/10.1175/BAMS-D-15-00082.1;COLOCATE: the Clarify-Oracles-Lasic-aerOClo-seAls Team Experiment;3;;ASDC;https://eosweb.larc.nasa.gov/project/airmspi/airmspi_table;;https://www.atmos-meas-tech.net/12/6505/2019/;N/A;N/A;N/A;FALSE;c2617190-cbba-44e6-b325-31edbf0c82dd;It appears that, to date, only the 2016 data has been archived on ADSC's website and made available on Earthdata search;"Review: Campaign tab: I’m counting either 48 or 50 flights based on the flight logs...did you account for the 10 ER-2 flights in your number?, The paper listed as the overview paper doesn’t seem to be an overview paper for just ORACLES, it seems like it’s about COLOCATE, The link listed for project data repository website links to an AirMSPI overview page, not an ORACLES website; Camp/Dep/Plt tab: HSRL-2 wasn’t flown on the P-3 until 2017 (https://www.atmos-meas-tech.net/12/6505/2019/amt-12-6505-2019.pdf), How did you find the tail number for the P-3?

SEAC4RS;Studies of Emissions and Atmospheric Composition, Clouds and Climate Coupling by Regional Surveys;;SEAC4RS was a field campaign that took place during August and September of 2013. It was based out of Ellington Field, Texas, but encompassed most of the continental United States, Southern Canada, and the Gulf of Mexico. The focus was on anthropogenic pollutants and how it travels through deep convection in the upper troposphere. The atmospheric heat budget effect on aerosol particle feedback was also studied. Data was gathered using both in-situ and remote sensing instruments. Both aircraft and ground stations were used. Satellite paths were also considered in order to do some calibration and/or validation for future missions.;Atmospheric Composition, Weather;Cloud characteristics, convection, air pollutants, trace gases, aerosols, atmospheric heat budget, monsoons, satellite accuracy, UT/LS chemistry;Continental United States, Southern Canada, Gulf of Mexico;56, 14, -78, -127;monsoon;8/1/2013;9/23/2013;1;8/12/13, 8/16/13, 8/21/13, 8/26-27/13, 8/30/13, 9/16/13, 9/23/13;RSP, TCP, UARP;;Hal Maring, Alex Pszenny, Ken Jucks;Owen Brian Toon;Gao Chen;Aircraft, Ground stations, Satellites, Balloons, Model outputs;DC-8, ER-2, Learjet;DC-8: 4-STAR, AOP, APR-2, AVOCET, BBR, CAFS, CAMS, CIT-CIMS, DACOM, DASH SP, DIAL-HSRL, DLH, GT-CIMS, HD-SP2, HR-AMS, ISAF, LARGE, MMS, NOy O3, PALMS, PI Neph, PT-RMS, SAGA, SPEC, SSFR, TD-LIF, WAS, DC-8 CAM, ER-2: AirMSPI, ALIAS, BBR, CPL, eMAS, FCDP, DLH, JLH, MMS, MTP, PCRS, RSP, SSFR, UAS-O3, WAS, Learjet: 2D-S, CPI, FCDP, FSSP, HVPS, Dew Point, LWC/TWC, Rosemount temperature, Rosemount icing rod, AIMMS-20, NMASS;AERONET, SEACIONS, TCCON, ozone sondes, water vapor sondes, GOES-East, GOES-West, CALIPSO, Cloudsat, ground-based radars;DIAL, HSRL, ARMOR, CFH, ECC;58;Aerosols, emissions, trace gases/trace species, atmospheric heating, upper level winds, convection, monsoon, environmental impacts;1130, 1132, 1206, 1235, 1360, 1362, 1563, 2509;N/A;;;;https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/2015JD024297;N/A;;;ASDC;https://www-air.larc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/ArcView/seac4rs;;https://espo.nasa.gov/seac4rs , https://www-air.larc.nasa.gov/missions/seac4rs/index.html;;UAH;https://www.uah.edu/;FALSE;50e316c6-41f6-444d-834e-fdfa6fbc80e2;;doi does actually exist.

SnowEx;SnowEx;;SnowEX is a five year program initiated and funded by NASA THP to address most important gaps in snow remote sensing knowledge. It focuses on airborne campaigns and field work, and on comparing the various sensing technologies, from the mature to the more experimental, in globally-representative types of snow. The goal is to address the most important gaps in our snow remote sensing knowledge, and thus lay the groundwork for a future snow satellite mission. SnowEx will is providing quantitative guidance for the optimal combination of snow remote sensing instruments and models, which in turn has potential to provide a new observational basis for water management across a broad geographic domain.;Global Water & Energy Cycle;Snow remote sensing, globally-representative types of snow, snow water equivalent, snow surface energy balance;Grand Mesa, CO & Senator Beck Basin, CO;39, 38, -107, -108;boreal winter;09/26/2016;ongoing;2;NID;NASA;Terrestrial Hydrology Program;Jared Entin;Ed Kim;Steve Tanner;Aircraft, Land-based Platforms, Models;B-200, P-3, G-III, Twin Otter;B-200: ASO, P-3: ESASSAR, CAR, QWIP, TINI, Video camera, G-III: UAVSAR, GLISTIN-A, Twin Otter: WISM;Ground sites;Riegl VZ-1000, Leica C-10 ScanStation;6;Snow depth, Snow water equivalent, Snow stratigraphy, Snow/ice temperature;2431, 2438, 2437, 2440;NID;SnowEx;https://docserver.gesdisc.eosdis.nasa.gov/public/project/Images/CAR_SNOWEX17_L1C_1.png;NASA;https://www.doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2017.8127222;NID;20;;NSIDC;https://nsidc.org/data/snowex;;https://snow.nasa.gov/snowex;N/A;NID;N/A;TRUE;998936f6-3b4e-4a82-8979-cd24c697a845;"Details are extensively available for 2017 only.

ACTIVATE;Aerosol Cloud meTerology Interactions oVer the western ATlantic Experiment;;"The overarching goal of ACTIVATE is to robustly characterize aerosol-cloud-meteorology interactions using extensive, systematic, and simultaneous in situ and remote sensing airborne measurements with two aircraft and a hierarchy of models. ACTIVATE focuses on marine boundary layer (MBL) clouds that span the continuum of stratiform and cumulus clouds and include post-frontal conditions. Together, these clouds cover more than 45% of the ocean surface and exert a large net cooling effect.

ACTIVATE has four fundamental science goals:
Improved understanding and model representations of relationships between number concentrations of aerosol (Na), cloud condensation nuclei (CCN), and cloud droplets (Nd) and the relationships between cloud micro/macro-physical properties

A unique dataset for international model intercomparison and process-based studies

An evaluation of current remote sensing retrievals and prototypes for future satellite missions

CAMP2Ex;Clouds, Aerosol, and Monsoon Processes-Philippines Experiment;;"The Cloud, Aerosol and Monsoon Processes Philippines Experiment (CAMP2Ex) is a response to the need to deconvolute the fields of tropical meteorology and aerosol science at the meso-b to cloud level. The operations will base at Clark International Airport (Philippines). The campaign is scheduled for mid-August to October 2019. 

Aerosol and cloud microphysics: Examine how aerosol particle concentration and composition affect the optical and microphysical properties of shallow cumulus and congest clouds; and how, ultimately, these effects relate to the transition from shallow to deeper convection. 

Cloud and Aerosol Radiation: Study how spatially inhomogeneous and changing aerosol and cloud fields impact three dimensional heating rates and fluxes, and determine the extent to which three dimensional effects may feedback into the evolution of the aerosol, cloud, and precipitation fields. 

Aerosol and cloud meteorology: Determine the meteorological features that are the most influential in regulating the distribution of aerosol particles throughout the regional atmosphere and, ultimately, aerosol lifecycle, and ascertain the extent to which aerosol-cloud interactions studies are confounded and/or modulated by co-varying meteorology.";Atmospheric Composition, Weather;aerosol, trace gases, aerosol-cloud interaction, precipitation, radiative fluxes;Philippines;TBD;monsoon, wet;8/20/2019;10/10/2019;1;;NASA Earth Science;;Hal Maring;Jeff Reid;Gao Chen;Aircraft, water-based platforms, ground-based platforms;"NASA P3-B Orion (Tail number N426NA)

FIREx-AQ;Fire Influence on Regional to Global Environments and Air Quality;;FIREX-AQ combines the previously separate NASA FIREChem and NOAA FIREX aircraft campaigns to better study the atmospheric effects of wildland and agricultural fires in the U.S. This offers significant advantages to the research community by optimally leveraging the scientific interests, personnel, and assets of NASA, NOAA, other agencies, and academic partners in a fully integrated program of field measurements, modeling, and interpretation. The joint FIREX-AQ program benefits from the knowledge base developed from detailed emissions characterization by NOAA and partners in the FIREX Fire Lab 2016 study. The NASA DC-8 aircraft offers an unparalleled payload capacity for comprehensive characterization of fire emissions, provides the flight envelope required to study chemical transformations during long-range transport, and enables sampling of both Western wildfires and agricultural/land-management burning emissions across the United States. The NOAA Twin Otter aircraft provides a complementary near-field ability to study daytime and nighttime chemical processing in lofted plumes from Western wildfires. The joint FIREX-AQ program further combines in-situ surface and airborne observations with remote sensing data to inform retrieval validation for wildfire emissions and plume optical properties.;Atmospheric Composition, Weather;tropospheric chemistry and composition, fire emissions, aerosols, atmospheric dynamics, smoke characteristics, weather;Northwestern and Southeastern US;;boreal summer;7/22/2019;9/5/2019;1;TBD;NASA and NOAA;;Barry Lefer;Jim Crawford;Gao Chen;Satellites, Model, In Situ Ground-based platforms, Aircraft;"NASA DC-8

AMISA;Arctic Mechanisms of Interaction Between the Surface and Atmosphere;;"AMISA studied the effects of global warming on Arctic ice formation. Measurements taken during this campaign included atmospheric temperature and humidity profiles, sea-ice surface imagery and measurements of atmospheric aerosol particle properties and their size distribution. Resulting data were used to study the relationship between cloud processes (microphysical properties and radiation profiles), aerosol transport trajectories, atmospheric radiation and the Arctic climate. This work helps researchers better understand the atmospheric processes influencing sea ice loss and growth, and provides data that will help improve the ability of missions such as AMSR-E to monitor the changing Arctic sea ice cover.

Aerosol sampling was performed over the Oden while it was moored in the Arctic Ocean and also over other wide-ranging areas of the Arctic. The sampling's goal was to determine the density and composition of biogenic and maritime aerosol flows into the near-polar Arctic inversion layer from the free troposphere and to map the sea ice. The mapping activity will serve to improve NASA satellite imaging of sea ice concentration.";Climate Variability & Change, Atmospheric Composition;;Arctic between Scandinavia and Greenland;89, 78, 115, -45;boreal summer;8/13/2008;8/25/2008;1;;Research opportunities in space and earth science- 2006 NASA Earth Science Division A.16 the International Polar Year (IPY);;Thomas Wagner;Al Gasiewski;N/A;Aircraft, Sea-based Platforms, Balloons;DC-8 - AFRC;PSR, DCR, TPR, SLFMR, CAPS, Dropsonde, pyranometers, pyrgeometers, VACC, OAT Rosemount Probe;ground-based platforms;Scanning Radiometer, Air Chemistry Sampling, S-band CLoud and Precip Radar, MAERI, Lidar, Rawinsondes, MMCR;5;Atmosphere, Cryosphere, Ocean;;;;;;;;;;Unpublished;"Meteorological Summary: ftp://ftp.library.noaa.gov/noaa_documents.lib/OAR/PSD/TM_OAR_PSD_314.pdf

Arctic;Arctic Sea Ice 2006 and Arctic 2007;The Arctic 2006 mission was conducted from March 18-29, 2006 using the NASA P-3 aircraft flying a remote sensing payload over the Arctic and Greenland polar regions. The focus of this campaign was on the validation of sea-ice concentration, snow depth on sea ice, and sea-ice temperature measurements from space. The Arctic 2006 campaign had three phases. Phase 1 focused on validating Aqua Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E) sea-ice products (also referred to as AMSRIce06). Phases 2 and 3 provided important measurements for validating the Geoscience Lase Altimeter System (GLAS) instrument on the Ice Cloud and Land Elevation Satellite (ICESat). In-situ measurements of snow and sea ice were also collected over the Arctic Ocean adjacent to Barrow, AK in addition to aircraft instrument measurements.;The Arctic 2006 campaign had three phases. .

The focus of this campaign was on the validation of sea-ice concentration, snow depth on sea ice, and sea-ice temperature. In-situ measurements of snow and sea ice were carried out over the Arctic Ocean adjacent to Barrow, AK. These measurements were overflown in order to validate the aircraft instruments. Patterns over the Arctic Ocean corresponding to AMSR-E pixels were flown for direct comparison with the AMSR-E snow depth retrievals.

CASIE;Characterization of Arctic Sea Ice Experiment;;"This mission will combine the use of a variety of remote sensing methods, including satellite observations and uninhabited aerial vehicles, to provide fundamental new insights into ice roughness on the scale of meters to tens of meters in the context of larger-scale environmental forcing. In addition, the mission offers a technological and operational testbed to demonstrate the value of autonomous vehicles for long-range, long-duration remote sensing science. In keeping with this, the mission has three science goals:

Determine the degree to which ice-roughness monitoring via remote sensing can detect basic changes in ice conditions such as ice thickness and ice age.
Investigate relationships between ice roughness and factors affecting the loss or maintenance of the perennial ice cover.

The campaign was designed to validate the measurement techniques of the QuickSCAT satellite using a Ku-band radiometer on the Wallops Flight Facility P-3B aircraft. The primary objectives of High Winds were to acquire coincident L-band radiometer and radar data over a wide range of ocean surface wind speeds and to acquire passive and active microwave data to enable the development of algorithms during high wind conditions. Flights were made during periods of predicted ocean surface winds in excess of 50 knots. Results demonstrated the feasibility of using radar backscatter to estimate the excess brightness temperature due to wind forcing.;Water & Energy Cycle;;North-Atlantic Ocean and Labrador Sea, Canada.;;;;;1;;NASA Energy and Water Cycle Study, Terrestrial Hydrology;;Jared Entin;Steven Dinardo;N/A;In-situ, Remote Sensing;NASA P-3 B;PALS, PolSCAT, GISMOS, GPSRS, AXCTD;;;;Ocean, Land Surface, Meteorology;;;;;;;QuikScat;;;Unpublished;;;https://airbornescience.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/documents/ASP09rpt.pdf https://airbornescience.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/documents/ASPnsltr_Apr_09.pdf;;CFB and the Canadian weather services;https://drive.google.com/file/d/11IY7kv1acwjtXuGGx2TTpWiEoScJRv4S/view;;;;;;;
HOPE EPOCH;Hands-On Project Experience (HOPE) Eastern Pacific Origins and Characteristics of Hurricanes (EPOCH);;The HOPE EPOCH mission was a joint mission between NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). This mission sought to provide a better understanding of tropical cyclogenesis, where tropical storms originated, and how they developed into hurricanes. The EPOCH project studied severe storm processes and intensification using the NASA Global Hawk unmanned aircraft, flying at altitudes of 60,000 ft. To investigate how storms develop into hurricanes and intensify, the science payload consists of a variety of NASA and NOAA instruments that measured different aspects of storm systems, including wind velocity, pressure, temperature, humidity, cloud moisture content and the overall structure of the storm system. Data collected will improve models that predict storm impact to coastal regions, property damage, and human life. The data from Dropsonde were incorporated into the NOAA national weather service operation model to improve storm tracking and forecast the intensity of storms.;Weather;;Pacific Ocean, Gulf of Mexico;;;;;1;;Sponsored by the Academy of Program/Project & Engineering Leadership (APPEL) program and NASA's Science Mission Directorate;;Ken Jucks;Amber Emory;N/A;Remote Sensing, In situ;Global Hawk;ER-2 X-band radar (EXRAD), High Altitude Monolithic Radiometer (HAMSR), Advanced Vertical Atmospheric Profiling System;;;;Meteorology;;;;;;;;;;Unpublished;;;"https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=6924

CAST;Coordinated Airborne Studies in the Tropics;;CAST was a collaborative initiative with NASA's Airborne Tropical Tropopause Experiment (ATTREX) program to study the Tropical Tropopause Layer (TTL) over the Pacific Ocean and Southeast Asia. CAST was a large multi-institutional project funded by the U.K. Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) and the Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC). CAST was part of a joint deployment with the NASA Airborne Tropical Tropopause Experiment (ATTREX) Global Hawk, the NSF CONTRAST, Gulfstream V (GV), and the Facility for the Airborne Atmospheric Measurements (FAAM) research aircraft. Measurements from these campaigns provided an excellent characterization of the lower-tropospheric atmospheric composition in the tropical warm pool region, and an improvement in our understanding of marine halocarbon production.;Atmospheric Composition;;A.B.

FIRE ACE;First (International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project) Regional Experiment, Arctic Cloud Experiment;;"The scientific objectives of FIRE.ACE will be to study impact of Arctic clouds on radiation exchange between surface, atmosphere, and space, and the influence of surface characteristics of sea ice, leads, and ice melt ponds on these clouds. FIRE.ACE will attempt to document, understand, and predict the Arctic cloud-radiation feedbacks, including changes in cloud fraction and vertical distribution, water vapor cloud content, cloud particle concentration and size, and cloud phase as atmospheric temperature and chemical composition change. FIRE.ACE will use the data to focus on improving current climate model simulations of the Arctic climate, especially with respect to clouds and their effects on the surface energy budget. In addition, FIRE.ACE will address a number of scientific questions dealing with radiation, cloud microphysics, and atmospheric chemistry.

The strategy of FIRE.ACE is to use aircraft to take remote and in situ measurements of the Arctic cloud and surface characteristics. The NASA ER-2 will fly far aloft with a suite of remote sensors to remotely infer the cloud and radiative properties of the clouds that form in the vicinity of leads and melt ponds. The University of Washington Convair 580, National Center for Atmospheric Research C-130, and Canada National Research Council Convair 580 aircraft each will fly with a number of in-situ instruments to measure the optical, physical, radiative, and chemical properties of the clouds and radiation directly.";;;Beaufort Sea;;;4/7/1998;7/30/1998;1;;;;;David McDougle, Robert Curran;;Aircraft, In-situ Ground-based Platforms, Model, Satellites;ER-2 - AFRC, Convair 580 - UW, C-130 - NCAR, Convair 580 - NRC;"Large-scale climatology project, designed to improve understanding of carbon and water cycles; coordinating satellite, aircraft, and ground instruments.

Field Experiment [FIFE], with deployments in 1987 and 1989 to the Konza Tallgrass Prairie near Manhattan, KS—see The FIFE and BOREAS Study Areas on pages 8–9—to measure surface properties (e.g., vegetation and vegetation status, soil moisture) and fluxes of heat, moisture, and trace species. The surface flux measurements were used as ground truth for the development and evaluation of algorithms to estimate fluxes from satellite observations. FIFE’87 had four, two-week deployments involving 5 satellites, 10 aircraft, and some 150 people. Researchers returned to Kansas two years later for a second round of experimentation on the Konza Prairie—FIFE’89. Measurement approaches were refined based on the results of FIFE’87 so as to resolve scientific questions that arose during subsequent algorithm development to estimate fluxes from satellites.";Des Groseilliers, FIRE, SHEBA, ARM, Barrow, NOAA Polar Orbiter 12, NOAA Polar Orbiter 14, DMSP F12, DMSP F12, Landsat 6, RESURS, RADARSAT, Earth Probe;;;;;;;;;;;;;ASDC;;;"https://eosweb.larc.nasa.gov/ACEDOCS

TRACE-P;Transport and Chemical Evolution over the Pacific;;TRACE-P is part of a long series of GTE aircraft missions aimed at better understanding of global tropospheric chemistry. The first objective of TRACE-P is to identify the major pathways for Asian outflow over the western Pacific, and to chemically characterize the outflow in a way that provides a basis for quantitative model analysis. The second objective of TRACE-P is to better understand the chemical and dynamical evolution of the Asian outflow over the west Pacific, focusing on tropospheric O3 and aerosols.;Atmospheric Composition;;Western Pacific;;;;;1;;;;Richard J.
