ACEPOL,Aerosol Characterization from Polarimeter and Lidar,"The Aerosol Characterization from Polarimeter and Lidar (ACEPOL) campaign will perform aerosol and cloud measurements over the USA from the NASA high altitude ER-2 aircraft using measurements from four spectro/photo polarimeters (RSP, AirMSPI, AirHARP, and AirSPEX) which differ in terms of spectral, angular, and spatial sampling. The measurements from these passive sensors will be complemented by measurements from active sensors (airborne HSRL-2 and CPL lidars).",Based from ARFC across western USA,,,"Dr. Hal Maring, Dr. Felix C.

ARESE,ARM (Atmospheric Radiation Measurement)ÿEnhanced Shortwave Experiment,"Experimental investigations prior to the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Enhanced Shortwave Experiment (ARESE) showed that the observed magnitude of the absorption of solar radiation by the cloudy sky exceeded model predictions. Radiation models indicated that cloudy skies absorbed about as much shortwave energy as clear skies, whereas the the magnitude of the absorption of solar radiation by the cloudy sky exceeds model predictions by varying amounts. In order to improve the accuracy of models, researchers wanted to measure the horizontal transport of photons by clouds. ARESE was conducted to study the magnitude and spectral characteristics of the absorption of solar radiation in cloudy, clear, and partly cloudy atmosphere.Three aircraft platforms, a Grob Egrett, a NASA ER-2, and a Twin Otter, were used during ARESE in conjunction with the Atmospheric Radiation Measurements (ARM) central and extended facilities in the Southern Great Plains of Oklahoma. The aircraft were coordinated to simultaneously measure the upwelling and downwelling radiative fluxes (and derive a net radiation flux) at the tropopause, near cloud top, and below cloud (specified) altitudes.","Southern Great Plains, Oklahoma ",,,Hal Maring,Dr. Fancisco Valero,"Gao Chen, Ozone Sonde, and Acoustical Optical Spectrometer-Photometer with Multiple Fields of View (aos-pmfov): N/A

Precipitation from ARs can provide beneficial water supply and snowpack and can create conditions for dangerous floods that threaten lives and property. The campaign produced a targeted set of aircraft and ship-based measurements and associated evaluation of data over regions offshore of California and in the eastern Pacific for an intensive observing period between January 2015 and March 2015.

The results of the SABOR campaign are contributing to the development of NASA?s Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud, ocean Ecosystem (PACE) mission and GSFC.

NOAA used real time data collected over the storms to feed directly into hurricane forecast models; these models help to better predict hurricane intensity. Understanding the intensity will help with disaster preparedness. ÿThis mission would help to fill in possible gaps in satellite data concerning forecasts and warnings. The primary goal of the SHOUT campaign was to determine the potential utility of observations from high-altitude, long- endurance unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) such as the Global Hawk aircraft to improve forecasts of high-impact weather events and mitigate potential degradation of forecasts in the event of a future gap in satellite coverage.","Carribean, Atlantic, Eastern Shore-VA",,,Bruce Tagg,Robbie Hood,Jebb Stewart,,"https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/psd2/coastal/satres/data/static/shout/2015_hurricane.html
