    "question": "What is a Field Investigation?",
    "answer": "An observational study during which individuals/programs/agencies/institutions utilize preselected, specific sensors or sets of sensors to acquire targeted observations in a natural, non-laboratory setting in support of common, clearly defined, science or research objectives.  Field investigations usually occur over a designated geographical space and/or period of time.  Sensors can include in-situ and/or remote sensing instruments operating on airborne, ground-based, and/or other non-satellite platform(s).  Satellite-based observations may be included in, but are not collected specifically as part of, a field investigation."
