    "question": "What is CASEI?",
    "answer": "The Catalog of Archived Suborbital Earth Science Investigations (CASEI) is a curated  inventory with information pertaining to NASA airborne and field campaigns, as well as information about the platforms and instruments used during the campaigns. CASEI also provides links to campaign data products via their digital object identifiers (DOIs). CASEI was designed to assist with data discoverability and accessibility. For more information, see the {{link.about}} for CASEI.",

    "section": "1 General Info",
    "question": "How is CASEI different from other NASA data resources?",
    "answer": "CASEI is unique in that it is an information portal that collates metadata from across all NASA data centers and projects. It is often overwhelming to figure out the appropriate source to download data from or which information to trust. CASEI team members have already vetted and verified the information included in CASEI, removing the guesswork and reducing the struggle to search for airborne and field data. {{linebreak}} Each campaign, platform, and instrument is intensively curated by three team members to ensure metadata quality and accuracy. This “human element” to the metadata curation makes it as thorough and accurate as possible."

    "section": "1 General Info",
    "question": "Does CASEI archive data?",
    "answer": "No, CASEI does not archive or store data. CASEI provides data product Digital Object Identifiers (DOI) that link to the data archived at the NASA Distributed Active Archive Centers (DAACs). The NASA DAACs are the official data centers, meaning they distribute and preserve the data and support data users."

  {
    "section": "1 General Info",
    "question": "What science topics does CASEI cover?",
    "answer": "Using the data linked in CASEI, scientists can study a variety of phenomena such as hurricanes, lightning, atmospheric chemistry, air quality, precipitation, algal blooms, sea ice, surface water, and land cover, to name a few."

    "section": "2 Inventory Content/What’s New",
    "question": "What kind of data can CASEI be used to discover?",
    "answer": "CASEI guides users to data collected during and associated with NASA airborne and field campaigns. These campaigns include different combinations of airborne data, field or ground-based data, ocean or water-based data, and also relevant or related satellite data and/or model outputs."

    "question": "What are Geophysical Concepts?",
    "answer": "Geophysical concepts are terms that correlate to the six NASA Earth Science Focus Areas and the Global Change Master Directory (GCMD) Earth Science Keywords, bridging the gap between the general and specific terms used to describe scientific studies and data. {{concepts}}",

    "section": "2 Inventory Content/What’s New",
    "question": "What does “suborbital” mean?",
    "answer": "For CASEI, suborbital means anything that is not in orbit around the Earth.  Therefore, suborbital includes measurements made in the air, on land, and on or within water."

    "section": "2 Inventory Content/What’s New",
    "question": "What is airborne data?",
    "answer": "Airborne data is that collected from instruments on board or attached to airplanes, drones, rockets, and balloons. Aircraft can be manned or unmanned. The term “balloons” refers to weather balloons, which usually carry instruments called “sondes” attached to the balloons by heavy duty string. Examples of these balloon payloads are ozonesondes or radiosondes, which measure ozone concentrations and vertical profiles of the atmosphere (like temperature, pressure, humidity), respectively. "

    "question": "What is ocean data?",
    "answer": "Ocean or water data is that collected from instruments on board or attached to ships, boats, buoys, {{link.saildrones}}, or {{link.wavegliders}}. Sometimes ships are deployed on the ocean, but sometimes small boats are deployed on a lake, in a river, or in a swamp to collect water samples for use in  analyzing water quality, for example.",

    "question": "How do I search for data?",
    "answer": "There are multiple ways to search for data using CASEI. Using the Explore page, you can filter your search results with different fields. {{explore}} You can get to the Explore page two ways: either by clicking the “Explore” at the top right of the screen from any page, or by clicking on the “Explore CASEI'' in the middle of the CASEI homepage. Both of these options will take you to CASEI’s Explore page. {{filter1}} Using the boxes at the top of the Explore page, you can filter your search results by a variety of fields. If you know the name of the campaign you are looking for, just type it into the search box on the top left. Other fields, such as focus area or geographical region have drop down boxes with lists to choose from. Multiple choices can be selected from these lists. Applied filters will be shown below the boxes. Campaigns that fit the criteria selected will be automatically listed. Clicking on the campaign boxes will take you to their respective homepages, where you can read more about each campaign. DOI links for the data products associated with the campaigns are located on the homepage. {{filter2}} You can also filter results by location using the map feature. Click on “show map” and a display with overlaid campaign bounding boxes will appear. When you select a bounding box, you will be automatically taken to the campaign associated with that box. {{filtermap}}",
