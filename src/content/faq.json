    "question": "What is CASEI?",
    "answer": "The Catalog of Archived Suborbital Earth Science Investigations (CASEI) is a curated  inventory with information pertaining to NASA airborne and field campaigns, as well as information about the platforms and instruments used during the campaigns. CASEI also provides links to campaign data products via their digital object identifiers (DOIs). CASEI was designed to assist with data discoverability and accessibility. For more information, see the {{link.about}} for CASEI.",

    "question": "How is CASEI different from other NASA data resources?",
    "answer": "CASEI is unique in that it is an information portal that collates metadata from across all NASA data centers and projects. It is often overwhelming to figure out the appropriate source to download data from or which information to trust. CASEI team members have already vetted and verified the information included in CASEI, removing the guesswork and reducing the struggle to search for airborne and field data. {{linebreak}} Each campaign, platform, and instrument is intensively curated by three team members to ensure metadata quality and accuracy. This “human element” to the metadata curation makes it as thorough and accurate as possible."

    "question": "Does CASEI archive data?",
    "answer": "No, CASEI does not archive or store data. CASEI provides data product Digital Object Identifiers (DOI) that link to the data archived at the NASA Distributed Active Archive Centers (DAACs). The NASA DAACs are the official data centers, meaning they distribute and preserve the data and support data users."
