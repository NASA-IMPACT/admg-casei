      "The traditional paradigm of NASA’s field investigations consists of a targeted collection of specific geophysical observations aimed at answering key science questions stemming from the investigation’s primary research objectives. Historically, investigation data have been stored at various NASA Distributed Active Archive Centers (DAACs), NASA Airborne Science facilities, field archives, or even individual researchers’ hard drives. Users of investigation data have typically been those involved in the investigation or in similar investigations. Over time, these knowledgeable researchers retire or move on to other studies, often leaving data isolated and/or inadequately documented, prohibiting reuse.",
      "With the increasing volume of multi-parameter field investigation data, NASA recognizes the value of measurements collected during previous campaigns both for answering new science questions and for studying changes to Earth’s systems and processes over time. CASEI exists to expedite discovery, access, and utilization of archived NASA field investigation data, maximizing the return on the Agency’s investments in their collection and preservation."
